End-to-End Data Pipeline and Analytics Solution for Retail Bike Store
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data lifecycle solution implemented for a retail bike store. The objective was to transform raw data into meaningful insights for business decision-making by leveraging modern cloud-based data engineering tools such as Azure Data Factory (ADF), Databricks, and Power BI.

Key Features
End-to-End Data Pipeline: Designed and implemented a robust data pipeline using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from raw file sources into structured data formats.
Data Profiling and Transformation: Utilized Databricks notebooks for in-depth data profiling, cleansing, transformation, and creation of lookup tables, ensuring data quality and consistency.
Infomart Creation: Structured data into Infomarts aligned with key business metrics, facilitating efficient data analysis and reporting.
Power BI Dashboards: Developed interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key metrics and provide actionable insights for senior management.
Workflow
Initial Planning & KPI Extraction:

Designed the data architecture and schema based on key performance indicators (KPIs) and business metrics relevant to the retail bike store.
Created a detailed data model diagram to guide the pipeline and analytics process.
Data Ingestion:

Used Azure Data Factory to extract data from raw file sources.
Data was first loaded into a staging area for initial processing and then moved into a landing zone for further use.
Data Profiling & Transformation:

Mounted data from the landing zone into Databricks for data profiling and transformation tasks.
Applied data transformations, created lookup tables, and prepared clean, structured data for analysis.
Infomart Creation:

Established Infomarts for each table in the schema, based on the KPIs and business metrics extracted during the initial phase.
Data was organized into two distinct data marts, tailored for targeted analysis.
Power BI Dashboard Development:

Loaded data marts into Power BI to create dynamic dashboards that presented the analyzed data.
Visualized key insights and trends to provide a comprehensive overview of business performance.
Dashboards were presented to senior management, along with strategic recommendations based on the analysis.
Tools & Technologies Used
Azure Data Factory (ADF): For orchestrating and automating the ETL processes.
Databricks: For advanced data processing, profiling, and transformation.
Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and delivering business insights.
SQL: For querying and manipulating the data.
Python: Used within Databricks for data transformation tasks.
Key Metrics & KPIs
The data pipeline and analysis focused on the following key metrics:

Sales performance by product, category, and region
Customer purchasing patterns and segmentation
Inventory turnover and stock analysis
Revenue growth trends and seasonality effects
Operational efficiency metrics, including lead time and delivery performance
How to Use
