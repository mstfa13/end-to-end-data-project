# Retail Bike Store End-to-End Data Project

This project showcases a complete data pipeline solution for a retail bike store, covering everything from raw data ingestion to business intelligence reporting. The focus is on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data to provide valuable insights for optimizing store performance, customer retention, and staff management.

## Key Components

### 1. **Data Ingestion (Azure Data Factory)**
   - Raw CSV files containing transactions, products, returns, staff, and store information are ingested into a staging area.
   - Data is dynamically loaded from multiple SQL databases and external staging sources into a central 'landing' folder.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation (Databricks)**
   - PySpark is used to clean and standardize the raw data, creating lookup tables for key fields such as `order_status`.
   - Lookup tables and fact/dimension tables are written as Delta tables for efficient querying and data management.
   - A star schema was modeled, connecting facts (e.g., transactions, returns) with dimensions (e.g., customers, stores, products) for easy analysis.
   
### 3. **Data Warehouse (Delta Tables)**
   - Fact and dimension tables are created, ensuring PK/FK relationships and calculated columns for metrics like total revenue, total orders, and discounts.
   - These Delta tables are stored for optimized querying and further analysis in business intelligence tools.

### 4. **Business Intelligence (Power BI)**
   - A dashboard was built in Power BI to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, sales trends, store performance, and customer retention rates.
   - Custom measures (e.g., `Total Revenue`, `Total Orders`, `Return Rates`) are used to provide deep insights into business operations.

### 5. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Predictive models to analyze customer churn and retention, focusing on store-level performance and staff impact on turnover.
   - Analysis of sales performance over time and across different locations, helping to drive strategic business decisions.

## Project Highlights
   - **Technologies Used**: Azure Data Factory, Databricks (PySpark), Delta Tables, Power BI.
   - **ETL Workflow**: Fully automated data pipeline from ingestion to visualization.
   - **Scalability**: Optimized for high data volumes with Delta tables and efficient data processing in PySpark.
   - **Business Impact**: Data-driven insights to improve store performance, manage staff turnover, and enhance customer retention.
